# Firstprinciple approach to Datacleaning
1) Problem Statement
   Real world dataset often deviate due to semantic syntatic inconsistency that gives wrong assumptions and values in dashboards and models these issue propagate to       error analysis and poor decision making.
2) Approach
  a) I foolowed first principle cleaning by preserving the raw then inspecting the data
  b) The next step that i followed is to analyse semantic and syntatic differences.
  c) Moving ahead cautiosly preserving and flagging semantic inconsistency and
     cleaning syntatic variations
  d) Validate aggressively at every step
  e) Prserve the final report as well as raw for tracebility
     
3) Decision
   a) Date parsing handled manually
   b) Manually cleaning was preffered before going for automation
   c) Date Automations intentionally avoided for misinterpretation
   d) Dataset kept small to focus on correctness rather than volume

4) Outcome
   a) Produced an analysis ready dataset for traceability and decision making
   b) Reduced hidden quality risk
   c) Created a reusable mental framework for unfamiliar datasets
